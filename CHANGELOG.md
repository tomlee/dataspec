# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is loosely
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); this project is
**alpha** and the public API may still change between releases.

## [v0.1.0a1] - first tagged alpha

- Core model: `Doc` (the guarded data-DOM) and the `Schema`/`Type` tree
  (`ScalarType`, `ArrayType`, `ObjectType`, `AnyType`, `RefType`).
- Schema DSL: `parse_schema` / `to_dsl`, plus a Python schema builder
  (`obj`, `arr`, `mapping`, `enum`, `optional`, `nullable`, `ref`, `schema`,
  and the `t` namespace for scalar atoms).
- Pluggable format registry with built-in JSON, YAML, TOML, and XML codecs
  (`read_*` / `write_*` / `check_*`), lenient by default with adjustment
  reporting (`WriteReport` / `Adjustment`) and an opt-in `strict` mode.
- `infer()` to draft a schema from example Documents.
- Schema comparison operations: `compatible_with`, `equivalent`, `normalize`.
- Full exception hierarchy under `DataspecError`.
- GitHub Actions CI running the test suite (228 tests) on Python 3.11–3.13.
- Complete documentation set: concepts, architecture, getting started, the
  `Doc` API, the schema language, format-by-format pages, inference, schema
  comparison, an API reference, and an FAQ — every code example verified
  against the library.
